# INTRODUCTION
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most famous ships in history. On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg while cruising, killing 1,502 of its 2,224 passengers and crew. The exciting event shocked the international community and led to better ship safety management.<\br>

One of the reasons why these wrecks caused so many casualties was that there were not enough lifeboats for passengers and crew. While there is some chance of surviving the sinking, some groups, such as women, children, and the upper classes, are more likely to survive than others. Click here to know more

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this challenge, we have been asked to complete an analysis to see what kind of people will survive. We specifically asked to use ML algorithm to predict which passengers will survive the crash.

# CONTENT
<li>Reading and Exploring data
Importing train and test data into notebook and understand overview of data

<li>Preparing Data
Outliers are trimmed out

<li>Exploratory Data Analysis
Dig in deeper into the predictive nature of each attributes available in data set and clean the data in such way that it could be used for modelling

<li>Breifing Workdone
Summarizing what has been done for each attributes to get clear picture

<li>Modelling
First, I splitted the train data intp 8:2 and fitted with models to check accurancy. the model with highest accuracy is selected for predicting survival in test data provided in competation
